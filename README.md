DLX FPGA - project made to program an FPGA (MODEL: ) with a DLX processor (running @60MHz or more) XILINX project.
The final project exists in the following directory: "lab7/lab7_source/SOURCE_S25".

Testing is perfomed using special programs (RESA) provided by the TAU university course, Advanced Computer Structures.

Notes:
The project was made gradually as can be seen from the lab2-lab7 directories.
The final project PDF, "lab7_final_OLD.pdf", is provided in the main directory. However, do note that it is not up to date (the final draft was lost, unfortunately).
That being said - it is mostly accurate, with only minor changes taking place.
