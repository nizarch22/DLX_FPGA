WARNING:NgdBuild:1212 - User specified non-default attribute value
   (83.3333333333333) was detected for the CLKIN_PERIOD attribute on DCM
   "XLXI_23/u0/u0".  This does not match the PERIOD constraint value (12 MHz.). 
   The uncertainty calculation will use the non-default attribute value.  This
   could result in incorrect uncertainty calculated for DCM output clocks.
